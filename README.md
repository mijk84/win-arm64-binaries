Software ports for Windows 10/11 ARM64

Check out the [releases](https://github.com/mijk84/win-arm64-binaries/releases) I compiled for Windows 10/11 ARM64.

All software was compiled using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) [Clangarm64](https://github.com/msys2/MSYS2-packages/issues/1787#issuecomment-980837586) in Windows 11 on a Samsung Galaxy Book Go. I am now using a Dell Inspiron 14 3420 with a Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2.
